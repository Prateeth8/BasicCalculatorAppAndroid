# BasicCalculatorAppAndroid
This is a very simple app created using xml and java in android studio.
The xml files are used to create buttons or layout.
The java code is written with the help of few basic built in functions that are already available in android studio.
+,-,*,/ are some of the basic functions available along with which we have the Neg which is used for the negative numbers and clear to completly clear the screen initializing the value to zero.
To create this we must have Androidstudio.exe with some important plugins.
